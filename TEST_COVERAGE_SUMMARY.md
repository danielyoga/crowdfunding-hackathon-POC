## 📝 Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests
1. Identify the feature/function to test
2. Choose appropriate test file (unit vs integration)
3. Follow existing test structure
4. Include positive and negative cases
5. Add edge case coverage

### Best Practices
- ✅ Clear test names describing what is tested
- ✅ Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- ✅ Independent tests (no shared state)
- ✅ Use `beforeEach` for common setup
- ✅ Test both success and failure paths

## 📚 Test Documentation

### Test File Structure
```
describe("ContractName", function() {
  beforeEach(async function() {
    // Setup code runs before each test
  });

  describe("Feature Group", function() {
    it("Should do something specific", async function() {
      // Arrange: Set up test conditions
      // Act: Execute the function
      // Assert: Verify expectations
    });
  });
});
```

### Assertion Examples
```typescript
expect(value).to.equal(expected);
expect(value).to.be.gt(minimum);
expect(value).to.be.closeTo(target, tolerance);
expect(tx).to.emit(contract, "EventName");
expect(fn).to.be.revertedWithCustomError(contract, "ErrorName");
```
