# 🚀 Web3 Milestone Crowdfunding Platform

A revolutionary blockchain-based crowdfunding platform that releases funds progressively through validated milestones, featuring user-defined risk profiles and democratic governance.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 💡 **Milestone-Based Fund Release**
- **5 Structured Milestones**: Prototype → Traction → Partnership → Revenue → Launch
- **Progressive Funding**: Funds released only upon milestone completion
- **Evidence-Based Validation**: IPFS-stored proof required for each milestone
- **Democratic Voting**: Funders vote on milestone completion (60% threshold)

### 🛡️ **User-Defined Risk Profiles**
- **Conservative (50/50)**: Maximum protection, 50% committed, 50% protected
- **Balanced (70/30)**: Recommended split for most funders
- **Aggressive (90/10)**: Maximum support for high-conviction believers
- **Individual Choice**: Each funder selects their own risk tolerance

### 🗳️ **Democratic Governance**
- **Mandatory Voting**: Funders must participate in milestone decisions
- **Weighted by Contribution**: Voting power based on funding amount
- **Anti-Whale Protection**: Maximum 20% voting power per funder
- **Penalty System**: Non-voters lose voting rights progressively

### 🔒 **Built-in Protection**
- **Automatic Refunds**: Available when projects fail validation
- **Risk-Based Refunds**: Calculated per funder's chosen risk profile
- **Platform Fees**: Only 2% to ensure sustainability
- **Emergency Governance**: Community can trigger failure votes
