## 💡 Key Insights

### What Makes This Project Special
1. **User-Defined Risk** - Most crowdfunding is one-size-fits-all. Your approach democratizes risk.
2. **Mandatory Participation** - Solves the "voter apathy" problem in DAO governance.
3. **Fair Refunds** - Each funder gets back what they protected, not a pooled average.
4. **Progressive Trust** - Founders earn funds through proof, not promises.

### Potential Concerns
1. **Complexity** - Risk profiles might confuse first-time users (needs good UX)
2. **Gas Costs** - Multiple loops could get expensive with many funders
3. **Centralization** - Founder has significant control (by design, but could add safeguards)
4. **Adoption** - Needs critical mass of both founders and funders
